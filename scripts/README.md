  <summary>index_page_functions.js</summary>
    <p>This file contains the action for the #auto-login-button on click event.
If the user still has a valid 'session' from logging into their admin user portal then if they end up back on the index page they can automatically log in.

If the user has logged out of the admin portal and then tries to log back in from index.php then instead of automatically logging them in they have the modal pop up to enter credentials.

This file also contains code that handles modal closures with sensitive login data.
When the user navigates away from the modal their username and password inputs are deleted as well as any error texts held in the #error-login span.
